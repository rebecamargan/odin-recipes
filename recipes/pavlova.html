    <h2>Golden Fig Pistachio Pavlova with Honey & White Chocolate Mascarpone<h2>
        <p>Pavlova starts with a fluffy baked meringue that is soft, 
            and marshmallow like on the inside and crisp on the outside. </p>
        <p> It is topped with loads of mascarpone cream sweetened with white chocolate and then topped with those chewy, 
            earthy figs, pistachios, white chocolate shavings, and a drizzle of honey which ties everything together.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>For the pavlova:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Trace a 6 inch circle in the center of the parchment to use as a guide for your meringue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the egg whites and salt in a large mixing bowl and beat until medium peaks form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the mixer on low speed, slowly beat in the water. Continue beating white adding in the sugar, little by little, until all sugar is incorporated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Up the mixer speed to high and continue to beat until very stiff peaks form - this may take several minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the vanilla and vinegar over the whipped egg whites and gently fold in, just slightly. Dust the cornstarch over the whites and continue to gently folding in, until just combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mound the egg whites in the center of your parchment circle. Smooth meringue into a dome. Scrape the sides up to the center top of the meringue to make vertical lines, then slightly level the top to make an indention for cream to be added to, once the meringue has baked and cooled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 275 degrees F. and continue to bake for another 45 minutes. At the end of that 45 minutes, turn the oven off but do not open the door! Turn the oven light on and let the meringue cool in the oven for at least one hour, or overnight, if desired. Remove from the oven. Once the meringue has fully cooled it can be filled.
                </li>
            </ol>>
        <p>For the white chocolate mascarpone:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place the chopped white chocolate in a small bowl and top with 1½ tablespoons of heavy whipping cream. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir until the chocolate fully melts and a smooth ganache is formed. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the remaining 1 cup of cream in a mixing bowl. Beat on high until stiff peaks form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the mascarpone to the whipped cream and beat again until just combined. Once the chocolate mixture is mostly cool, pour it into the cream mixture and beat again, until just combined. Refrigerate cream, covered, until needed.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>To top</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Carefully lift the cooled meringue and peel the parchment paper off of the bottom. Place on a serving dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon the cold cream mixture onto the top of the meringue.
                </li>    
                <li>
                    Top with whole golden figs(slice a few as well, and place around the top), and sprinkle with chopped pistachios and white chocolate shavings. Drizzle with honey.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve chilled in slices.
                </li>
             </ol>
